we run k8s cluster on AWS,local or dedicated servers
to run kubernetes and create Cluster we use a toold called minikube
first you need to download minikue and install it , it is a microservice provided to create cluster of kubernetes
we then use minikube start to start the cluster it will print Done! kubectl is now configued to use minikube cluster and default namespace by default
check status : minikube status
stop cluster : minikube stop

kuubectl get all -A : shows every thing that is present in cluster
kuubectl get pods -A : shows all the pods present in the cluster (pods are microservices inside worker node)
kuubectl get nodes -A : shows all the nodes(Control plane & worker)


if we want nodes during start then : minikube start --nodes=2

when we type this kuubectl get pods -A  we will sse that few pods are already running those are services we discussed int theory(ETCD API server etc) thus it means those microservices are docker container themselves
Kubernetes itself runs on top of docker services

minikube delete --all : deletes all pods in a cluster
minikube image list : shows all the images present in the cluster

when we type kuubectl get nodes -A  for the first time then we will only see we will only see Control Plane as for the first time there are no worker nodes yet

to push the image directly to clusster
minikube image load <ImageName>
here it is : minikube image load kubernetes-teset-app:latest

deployment.yaml
download vscode kubernetes extention and then type deploy on type enter to get the code snippet

apiVersion : any namespace
kind should be deployment file
metadata additonal info
spec: features 
replicas : 2 number of pods
image: should have name and tag
imagePullPolicy : default is remote repo if you put Never then it wont look in repo it will look in local
resources : each nodes specs
ports: port number where app should be put 

service.yaml
common end point for all pods
